OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
The airbnb project is a web development project that simulates building a real-world accomodation booking platform similar to Airbnb. It focuses on designing, developing, and deploying a scalable, secure backend system that manages users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews. The goal simply is to gain a deep understanding of modern software engineering workflows from database design to API development, team collaboration, and deployment automation.

TECHNOLOGY STACK
Backend Framework ---- Django(Python)
Database ---- MySql
ORM ---- Django ORM
API Layer ---- Django REST Framework
Containerization ---- Docker
Version Control ---- Git and Github
CI/CD Pipeline ---- Github Actions
Authentication ---- JWT / OAuth2

Team Roles
Software Developer ---- Responsible for coding the airbnb project as well as well as solving any technical problems that may emerge during the development lifecycle.
DevOps Engineer ---- Responsible for facilitating cooperation between development and operations teams by building CI/CD pipelines for faster delivery, faster iteations and faste deployment.
Test Automation Engineer ---- Designs a test automation ecosystem and writes and maintains test scripts for automated testing.

Technology Stack
Django(Python) ---- This would be the web framework that would be used for building RESTful APIs.
MySql ---- This would be the database to be used to manage user data.
Docker ---- This would be used for Containerization.
Django REST Framework ---- This would be the API Layer obtainable.
Git and Github ---- This would be used for version control.
Github Actions ---- This would be used for CI/CD Pipelines.
JWT / OAuth2 ---- This would be used for Authentication.
